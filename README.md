# Mobile Flashcards Project Overview

In this project, a user in either Android or iOS is able to create, update, or review decks of flashcards. A new deck can be created and new cards can be added to it containing both a question and answer. Other features include:
* List all decks
* Create a new deck and and update existing decks by adding new cards containing questions and answers.
* Start a quiz and determine if you answered questions correctly. Scores are tallied at the end of each quiz.
* Get local notifications daily at 8PM


Testing was done on both Android and iOS emulators.

Dummy data is created in api.js with two decks and state changes are persisted to AsyncStorage.
